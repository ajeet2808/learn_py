# the constructor's name is always __init__;
# it has to have at least one parameter; the parameter is used to represent the newly created object - you can use the parameter to manipulate the object, and to enrich it with the needed properties;
# note: the parameter is usually named self - it's only a convention, but you should follow it - it simplifies the process of reading and understanding your code.
